## Hello friends,
## I'm attempting to learn how to code once again. I studied CS during my first round of undergraduate studies but was unsuccessful upon 
## landing myself in a summer course [data structures] and failing calculus II. I have experience working in Python, C++ and a bit of HTML.
## My primary goal is to solidify my skills and gain employment. If there are any resources or tutorials I should know about to get me back
## on my feet, please share them with me! 

## Thanks,
## Charlie
## PS Keep learning
